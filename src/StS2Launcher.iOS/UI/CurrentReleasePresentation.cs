Candidate 0.0.148 preserves that runtime and has now reached Gate D on-device, where the receipt-backed OfflineReady reproof can spend a long time hashing the large game PCK without exposing nested byte progress. Step 35.0.26 / 0.0.149 keeps the proven bridge/Gate-C behavior unchanged, forwards Gate-D OfflineReady file/byte progress, adds a dedicated progress bar/latest-file/rate UI plus a one-second liveness heartbeat while a single large SHA-1 is still in flight, and warms Codemagic's exact pinned .NET+iOS workload cache.";

Physical 0.0.146 completed the 37-pointer reverse bridge, cache adoption, and GD_OnCoreApiAssemblyLoaded callback; 0.0.147 added the exact post-bootstrap resolver seal. The current 0.0.149 candidate does not alter that bridge or Gate-C contract: it makes the long Gate-D full-tree integrity audit observable and reduces repeat Codemagic setup by caching/verifying the pinned .NET 9.0.314 + iOS workload 9.0.314.3 toolchain.";
