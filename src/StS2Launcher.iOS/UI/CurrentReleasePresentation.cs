        "Physical 0.0.146 proved the complete generated Godot managed-plugin bootstrap on-device: ManagedCallbacks.Create returned 37 non-null pointers, ScriptManagerBridge.LookupScriptsInAssembly returned, GDMonoCache cache adoption made reverseBindingReady=true, and GD_OnCoreApiAssemblyLoaded returned. Gate C then stopped before target binding because its resolver guard still compared against the older pre-bootstrap 2-managed/1-host/1-private callback-handoff snapshot even though the verified bootstrap itself legitimately produced an exact eight-request host-framework delta. Step 35.0.24 / 0.0.147 preserves the bootstrap unchanged, validates that exact physical 0.0.146 delta, seals a post-bootstrap resolver baseline, and requires zero resolver/native drift from that new baseline before natural Gate C.";

        "Status: Steps 32–34 are CLOSED POSITIVE at 4/4. Step 35 remains OPEN. Physical 0.0.143 proved the 225-pointer managed->native handoff; 0.0.144 localized native->managed failure to GS035; 0.0.145 proved the missing reverse cache; and 0.0.146 physically completed the 37-pointer reverse bridge, cache adoption, and GD_OnCoreApiAssemblyLoaded callback. Candidate 0.0.147 changes only resolver-baseline accounting around that successful bootstrap: the exact eight added host-framework requests must match the measured closure, then the resolver state is frozen before natural Gate C. No second CLR, game native executable, fabricated callbacks, or GDMono runtime ownership is introduced.";
