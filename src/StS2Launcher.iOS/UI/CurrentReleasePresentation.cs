        "Physical 0.0.140 completed all three controls. NATURAL advanced through the Godot dictionary thunk to godot_dictionary::GetUnsafeAddress (GS031). OS-RECON passed the managed dictionary assignment, entered Godot.OS..cctor, then StringName.op_Implicit and NativeFuncs.godotsharp_string_name_new_from_string (GS024). FORWARD passed both command-line critical boundaries and CommandLineHelper.TryGetValue, then reached GodotFileIo.CreateDirectory -> Godot.DirAccess.DirExistsAbsolute and reproduced the same StringName -> GS024 callback boundary. Step 35.0.18 / 0.0.141 preserves those controls and adds a separately gated CORE-HANDOFF mode that requires the already-proven Step-15 smoke engine, obtains Godot 4.5.1's exact source-built runtime interop callback table, initializes only the verified private GodotSharp derivative with that table, and then runs the natural ExecuteVeryEarly diagnostic path.";

    public const string InitialStatus =
        "Status: Steps 32–34 are CLOSED POSITIVE at 4/4. Step 35 remains OPEN. Physical 0.0.140 establishes that the failure is a general GodotSharp-before-native-callback-initialization boundary rather than a command-line-specific defect. Candidate 0.0.141 does not fabricate callbacks and never loads the game native executable. NATURAL/OS-RECON/FORWARD retain their fresh-process/no-Godot contracts. CORE-HANDOFF is the sole explicit exception: after Step 15 proves its project-owned Godot engine live, it requires no dotnet project feature and no Godot-managed runtime, obtains the exact callback table from that same source-built Godot 4.5.1 engine, copies it once through GodotSharp NativeFuncs.Initialize(IntPtr,int), then invokes the verified natural diagnostic derivative. A diagnostic 4/4 still cannot close exact Step 35.";
